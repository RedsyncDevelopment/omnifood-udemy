# Introduction

Omnifood - Food Order App is a first website I have ever build that is somehow good looking and where I really took my time to understand how semantic HTML5 and CSS3 work together. Before this app it was googling almost everything related to CSS and how it work, and how to position some elements but this project gave me a lot.

## 1.1. How it works

There is not that mush to say about this website and how it work because - it doesn't. I mean it works but it's a single page and it's more about the design that it's functionality.

# Used Technologies

This website is made from scratch with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. There are non frameworks included.

## HTML5

According to Wikipedia HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. I won't go into the details of what HTML is and how browser work to display it's content because this is not the part of this project. Never the less, understanding how browsers work should be a crucial part of learning how to become a web developer.
Also, there is no need to take a deep dive into difference between HTML5 and it's predecessors because today all browser support almost all HTML5 features and tags but if you are interested in browser support for something specific you can look it up here: [https://caniuse.com/](https://caniuse.com/)

## 2.2. CSS3

Same as the HTML5, CSS3 introduced some new features, like "flexbox" and "grid". There is a lot going on in a CSS community and one could say it's really hard to stay tuned with everything coming out, but understanding of some core features that are supported in most of the browsers is always a good idea - we developer won't let a feature in if it's not making our life easier.

## 2.3. JavaScript

Ahh, JavaScript. There is a saying among developers - everything that can be built using JavaScript will one day be build with JavaScript. At the time I'm writing this article I have embraced TypeScript, and recently I worked on a project that used JavaScript and I can say it was hard - especially if you work in VSCode and have IntelliSense. TypeScript is a great superset for JavaScript and you should definitely use it.

# 3. What Have I Learned?

As this was my first real project in front-end development, I've learned a lot. Before this project I've worked with Databases and C++ and had never invest time in building User Interfaces. I won't go into details as I mentioned before that at the time I'm writing this, I already became a solid front-end engineer who is working with React, NextJS, Vue and other front-end frameworks.
